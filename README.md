# How Much Sentiment Can Be Carried by Modal Particles?

This is a term paper for the MA program in SS24, titled "Deep Learning in NLP" at Heinrich-Heine University. This study is based on amy previous paper about modal particles(in Appendix A). I appreciate your understanding regarding its preliminary nature. I welcome any inquiries or discussions related to this research.

Abstract:
 This paper explores the emotional tendencies of German modal particles based on real-world sentence data. Building on a previous study that compared modal particles with expressive emojis through a survey, this research uses sentiment analysis to calculate average emotional values for selected particles (ja, doch, schon, etc.). Three models were tested to compare their performance. The goal of this study is to quantify the sentiment carried by German modal particles and examine to what extent they encode affective meaning. By comparing three sentiment analysis models(FastText, Hugging Face pipeline, and BERT), this research investigates whether similar sentimental patterns are detected across models, which model responds most sensitively to subtle sentiment shifts, and which modelâ€™s output aligns most closely with human evaluation from a previous study. The findings are intended to inform future strategies for mapping sentiment-driven features in multilingual translation contexts.
